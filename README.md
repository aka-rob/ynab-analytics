# You Need a Budget Analytics

[You Need A Budget](https://www.ynab.com) is a budgeting app that uses four rules to help people reduce stress around finances.

I have been using it since 2012, and have come across a few areas where I wish there was more functionality. One area is reporting, the other is debt management.

## Reporting
YNAB provides views of analogous to an income statement for income vs. expenses. It also provides a [dreaded pie chart](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-case-against-the-pie-chart-43f4c3fccc6) of payees over specified periods of time. None of these views tell me, "over the past paycheck, where did I screw up?" The budget analysis notebook is my first look into these questions.

## Debt management
Each month, YNAB resets budget categories that have gone negative. This creates an issue where there is no tracking for historical overages. Reasons these might occur could be - car repairs, vet bills, fancy dinner with your spouse, or moving to a different state. The list is endless, which makes planning for them (sometimes) impossible. The reality is, it happens. When visibility is limited or non-existant, it is difficult to correct the issue. I haven't coded this out yet, but will take an approach in the coming weeks.
